This project can be used to send personalized whatsapp messages to multiple contacts within a very short period of time. This app can be used on MacOS and windows.

## MacOS
- Install python by opening terminal and typing <code>brew install python </code>.
- Once python is installed, install selenium <code>pip install selenium </code> or <code> pip3 install selenium </code>
- Create a folder where you will store all the files for this application.
- Get a copy of <code> send.py </code> and keep it in the folder that you made.
- Go to [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and download the chrome driver according to your chrome version and OS. Extract The file in the same folder as the code.
- Once you have your contacts files and the message file in the computer, go to the terminal and type the following code:
- <code> cd path/of/the/directory/with/code </code>.
- <code> python send.py </code> or <code> python3 send.py </code>
